Hi

This is a calculator with almost same rules that other calculators from Windows and smartphones. Those are :

1. There is no shortened form of multiplication like "2(1\*2+4)". You should type or click "X" to multiply.
2. First of all, format of square root and exponent would be "2^0.5(this is same sqrt(2))". When you are using square root or exponent, you should type or click in the base value to have auto power (0.5 for square root) or "^" to manually enter power.
3. Any invalid format will be removed automatically or error message will be displayed in such cases like "1( to (" or "() to none"
4. Error messages for critical error or undefined will be displayed in such cases like division 0 or square root of negative value

Ruels that the calculator only has are the followings:

1. when you are using exponent ( x ^ y), if you want to set the base or power using [+, - , *, /], then you should enclose them with parenthese, or nearest value from "^" will be chosen as base and power. O (1+2*3/4)^(5+6*7/8), X 1+2*3/4^5+6*7/8
2. If you press WTI button to get a price, you can also do the calculation with this value follwing operations (should be +,-,/,\*,^)
